        "## Inn Hotels Bookings\n",
        "#### Context\n",
        "A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost, which benefits hotel guests. However, it is a less desirable and potentially revenue-diminishing factor for hotels. Such losses are particularly high for last-minute cancellations.\n",
        "\n",
        "New technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customers' booking possibilities and behavior, adding further complexity to how hotels manage cancellations. These are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cancellations impact hotels in several ways:\n",
        "1. **Loss of resources** (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.\n",
        "2. **Additional distribution costs**, including increased commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.\n",
        "3. **Last-minute price reductions** to resell a room, lowering the profit margin.\n",
        "4. **Increased human resource needs** to manage guest arrangements.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Objective\n",
        "The rising number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning-based solution to predict which bookings are likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group, a hotel chain in Portugal, is facing problems with high booking cancellations. They have sought out your firm for a data-driven solution. As a data scientist, your task is to analyze the provided data to identify the factors most influential on booking cancellations. You will then build a predictive model to anticipate cancellations in advance, helping the hotel formulate profitable cancellation and refund policies.\n",
